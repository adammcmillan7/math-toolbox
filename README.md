# math-toolbox

## Introduction
This is a collection of math-related projects, ideas, and experiments that are too small for their own github repo. A lot of this repo was made in [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), and as such I encourage you to open these files in Mathematica to access interactive elements, but for those without access to Mathematica I have included static PDF copies of Mathematica notebooks.

As this repo is a great mix of different topics and interests, any documentation or commentary is included as comments in each individual file.

Some of my favorites:

[Using Fourier Series to Numerically Model and its Convergence](Modeling/FourierSeriesConvergence.nb) | [PDF](Modeling/FourierSeriesConvergence.pdf)

[Realistic ODE Model of a Building's Temperature](Modeling/TemperatureOfABuildingODE.nb) | [PDF](Modeling/TemperatureOfABuildingODE.pdf)

[Basic Analysis of Newton's and Bisection Root-Finding Methods](RootFindingMethods/NewtonsBisectionMethods.nb) | [PDF](RootFindingMethods/NewtonsBisectionMethods.pdf)
