# math-toolbox

## Introduction
This is a collection of math-related projects, ideas, and experiments that are too small for their own github repo. A lot of this repo was made in [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), and as such I encourage you to open these files in Mathematica to access interactive elements, but for those without access to Mathematica I have included static PDF copies of Mathematica notebooks.

My interests in these topics are almost always functionality and practicality, and as such my focus is more on efficient implementation and error/convergence analysis, less on formal proofs and definitions. Because of this, some language I use may not perfectly align with the formal definition of whatever topic I'm discussing.

As this repo is a great mix of different topics and interests, any documentation or commentary is included as comments in each individual file.

Some of my favorites:

[Using Fourier Series to Numerically Model and its Convergence](Modeling/FourierSeriesConvergence.nb) | [PDF](Modeling/FourierSeriesConvergence.pdf)

[Realistic ODE Model of a Building's Temperature](Modeling/TemperatureOfABuildingODE.nb) | [PDF](Modeling/TemperatureOfABuildingODE.pdf)

[Basic Analysis of Newton's and Bisection Root-Finding Methods](RootFindingMethods/NewtonsBisectionMethods.nb) | [PDF](RootFindingMethods/NewtonsBisectionMethods.pdf)

[Using Nested Form to Improve Polynomial Evaluation to Near Constant Time](NestedPolynomialEvaluation.py) | [ScatterPlot](/PolyEvalPyPlot1.png)
